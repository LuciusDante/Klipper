# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section to
# enable move transformations that offset the z axis based on a mesh
# generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh and bed_tilt are
# incompatible, both cannot be defined. When using a probe to home the
# z-axis, it is recommended to define a [homing_override] section in
# printer.cfg to home toward the center of the print area.
#
#  Visual Examples:
#   rectangular bed, probe_count = 3,3:
#               x---x---x (max_point)
#               |
#               x---x---x
#                       |
#   (min_point) x---x---x
#
#   round bed, round_probe_count = 5, bed_radius = r:
#                  x (0,r) end
#                /
#              x---x---x
#                        \
#   (-r,0) x---x---x---x---x (r,0)
#            \
#              x---x---x
#                    /
#                  x  (0,-r) start
#

#[bed_mesh]
#speed: 50

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.

#horizontal_move_z: 5

#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center x,y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0,0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.

#mesh_min: 25,25

#   Defines the minimum x,y coodinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.

#mesh_max: 275,275

#   Defines the maximum x,y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.

#probe_count: 5,5

#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values (X,Y) defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3,3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2,2
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2,2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.

# Bed tilt compensation. One may define a [bed_tilt] config section to
# enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed.
#[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
#z_adjust: 0
#   The amount to add to the Z height when the nozzle is nominally at
#   0,0. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that may be used to calibrate appropriate x and y
# adjustment parameters.
#points:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE

#   is above the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. The default is
#   to not enable the command.

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.

# Tool to help adjust bed leveling screws. One may define a
# [bed_screws] config section to enable a BED_SCREWS_ADJUST g-code
# command.
#[bed_screws]
#screw1: 100,100
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This parameter must be provided.
#screw1_name: front screw
#   An arbitrary name for the given screw. This name is displayed when
#   the helper script runs. The default is to use a name based upon
#   the screw XY location.

#...
#   Additional bed leveling screws. At least three screws must be
#   defined.

#   to a probe_height position. The default is 5.

# Tool to help adjust bed screws tilt using Z probe. One may define a

# SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE g-code command.
#[screws_tilt_adjust]
#screw1: 100,100
#   The X,Y coordinate of the first bed leveling screw. This is a
#   position to command the nozzle to that is directly above the bed
#   screw (or as close as possible while still being above the bed).
#   This is the base screw used in calculations. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#screw1_name: front screw

#   direction of the knob used to level the bed, clockwise decrease
#   counter-clockwise decrease.
#   Accepted values: CW-M3, CCW-M3, CW-M4, CCW-M4, CW-M5, CCW-M5.
#   Default value is CW-M3, most printers use an M3 screw and
#   turning the knob clockwise decrease distance.

# Multiple Z stepper tilt adjustment. This feature enables independent
# adjustment of multiple z steppers (see stepper_z1 section below) to
# adjust for tilt. If this section is present then a Z_TILT_ADJUST
# extended G-Code command becomes available.
#[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

# Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors.
# Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry
# which is more flexible.
# WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results.
# If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code
# command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z
# motor configuration:
# ----------------
# |Z1          Z2|
# |  ---------   |
# |  |       |   |
# |  |       |   |
# |  x--------   |

# ----------------
# Where x is the (0,0) point on the bed
#[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X,Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X,Y points that should be probed

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an ajustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.

# Printer Skew Correction. It is possible to use software to correct
# printer skew across 3 planes, xy, xz, yz. This is done by printing a
# calibration model along a plane and measuring three lengths. Due to
# the nature of skew correction these lengths are set via gcode. See
# skew_correction.md and G-Codes.md in the docs directory for details.

# Bed probing hardware
######################################################################

# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.

#[probe]
#pin: P1.27

#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
#x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#y_offset: 38.76
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
#z_offset: -1.55
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#samples: 1
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0

#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.

#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 0
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
# section) to enable a BLTouch probe. See the docs/BLTouch.md guide
# for further information on configuring a BLTouch. A virtual
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
# section above for the details).

#   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
#   this to False. The default is True.
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.
